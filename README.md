# 📊 Vendor Performance Analysis
### 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor and brand performance in the retail and wholesale industry. The goal is to help businesses identify underperforming brands, optimize pricing strategies, assess bulk purchasing impact, and evaluate vendor dependency to improve profitability and inventory efficiency.

The repository includes:

* Business Problem Report – a detailed document highlighting business challenges, data insights, and key findings.

* Jupyter Notebooks – Python notebooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), filtering, and visualization.

### 🎯 Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability. Companies often face challenges such as:

* Losses due to inefficient pricing or procurement.

* Overstocking and poor inventory turnover.

* Vendor dependency risks.

* Profitability variance between high- and low-performing vendors.

This analysis addresses these issues by leveraging data-driven insights.

### 🔍 Key Insights
